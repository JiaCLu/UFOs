The format of date must enter (d/m/yyyy) in order to filter out specific date will appear in the webpage. In the example above, date filter to 1/4/2010 return different cities, states, shape, duration, and comments for the date that was chose.

## Summary:

The overall UFOs webpage is clean and neat with the clear page layout. However, there is one drawback of this webpage when there are over 30 results layout in the one page is not easy to scroll down.

### Recommendations for further development

1. Instead of having over 30 results in single page, separate 10 results in a page with next button for the more results.

2. In the first recommendation, create sorting by date and city either descending or ascending order to allow clear visual results for the users.
